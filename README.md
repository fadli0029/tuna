My reimplementations of various stuff from the C++ standard library, whichever ones I find I'd learn the most from by building from scratch. Basically this is for my learning and understanding purposes (I attempted implementing `std::vector` from scratch a while ago when I first read Stroustrup's PPP book, oh man I learn a lot just from that attempt).

Why call it `tuna`? Well I don't know. I know I like fish though. Tuna is just one of many fish types I like. I reserve other fish names for my other projects in the future.

# In progress
- [ ] `tuna::allocator`: implementation of the `std::allocator` + `allocator_traits` interface

# TODO's
- [ ] `tuna::vector`: implementation of `std::vector`
- [ ] `tuna::unique_ptr`: implementation of `std::unique_ptr`
- [ ] `tuna::shared_ptr` + `tuna::weak_ptr`: implementation of `std::shared_ptr` + `std::weak_ptr`
- [ ] `tuna::string`: implementation of `std::string`
- [ ] `tuna::optional`: implementation of `std::optional`
- [ ] `tuna::function`: implementation of `std::function`
- [ ] `tuna::expected`: implementation of `std::expected`
- [ ] `type_traits`: implementation of the standard library `type_traits` header
